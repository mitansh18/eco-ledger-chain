# 🌱 EcoLedger - Complete Carbon Credit Verification System

## ✅ Project Status: HACKATHON READY!

**EcoLedger** is a fully functional web application for verifying mangrove plantation projects and issuing carbon credits using AI verification models and blockchain technology. 

### 🚀 What's Built

#### 🤖 AI Verification Pipeline (6 Flask APIs)
- **YOLOv8 Tree Detection** (Port 5001): Counts mangrove trees from images
- **NDVI Vegetation Health** (Port 5002): Analyzes vegetation health from satellite imagery
- **IoT Environmental Data** (Port 5003): Processes soil/environment sensor data
- **CO₂ Absorption Calculator** (Port 5004): Estimates carbon sequestration
- **Final Score API** (Port 5005): Combines all metrics with weighted formula
- **Blockchain Ledger Service** (Port 5006): Immutable record storage & credit transfers

#### 🎯 Complete Frontend (Next.js + React + TypeScript)
- **NGO Dashboard**: Upload project data, track AI verification pipeline
- **Carbon Credit Marketplace**: Companies browse and purchase verified credits  
- **Blockchain Ledger Viewer**: Explore transactions, blocks, and credit records
- **Real-time Processing**: Live updates during AI verification workflow

#### 🔗 Blockchain Integration
- **Immutable Verification Records**: SHA-256 hashed blocks with project data
- **Smart Carbon Credit Issuance**: Automated based on AI verification scores
- **Transparent Marketplace**: Real-time credit transfers on simulated ledger
- **Query System**: Search by transaction hash, project ID, or NGO

### 📊 AI Scoring Formula (As Specified)
```
AI_Tree_Score = Trees_Detected / Trees_Claimed
Final_Score = 0.4×AI_Tree_Score + 0.3×NDVI_Score + 0.2×IoT_Score + 0.1×Audit_Check
Carbon_Credits = (CO₂_Absorbed / 1000) × Final_Score
```

### 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start
